/**
 * Authors: Joshua Hizgiaev, Ethan Friedman, and Helios Gayibor as of Robotics Year 2022
 * 
 * Description: OI goes hand in hand with Constants, since they both serve similar purposes, 
 * the main purpose is for all of your inputs (such as joysticks) to go into OI and the main 
 * robot program will call functions from OI.
 * This class acts as a replacement class for the pre-generated RobotContainer.java class
 * 
 * Originally this class was created in order to create methods to check if certain buttons were 
 * pressed, such as intake button, launcher, conveyor, etc. However this is useless as long as constants
 * are well defined hence why the OI class is so empty compared to previous years and recommended it stays 
 * that way to avoid confusion, have proper efficency, and actually makes sense - Josh.H 2022
